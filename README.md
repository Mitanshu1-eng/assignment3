Task 1: Factorial Using a Function

In this task, I wrote a Python program that asks the user for a number and finds its factorial.
I made a function called factorial() which takes a number and multiplies all the numbers from 1 to that number.
The program then shows the factorial of the number entered by the user.

Task 2: Using the Math Module

In this task, I wrote a Python program that takes a number from the user and uses the math module to do different calculations.
The program finds the square root, natural log, and sine value of the number.
After calculating, the program prints all the results.
